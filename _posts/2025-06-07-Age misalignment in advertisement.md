📣 60% of Swiss Millennials follow influencers. Over half of them buy what those influencers recommend.

Let that sink in.

Influencer marketing isn’t just a trend it’s becoming a strategic pillar. The study surveyed:
👨‍💼 218 Marketing Managers
📲 124 Influencers
🧑‍🎓 1007 Millennials (aged 13–30)

And the takeaway? Influencer marketing is not only widely adopted and perceived as effective, it’s also delivering better ROI than traditional formats, for those using it well.

But here’s the catch: Marketing managers are often older than the these young audiences, and it shows. For example:
- 76% of young consumers said Instagram is the platform... only 28% of marketers agreed.
- 18% of marketers think Facebook still matters to the young... only 2% of young respondents agreed.
- Marketers picked Roger Federer as the ideal youth influencer (34%)... Gen Z/Millennials? Less than 1% mentioned him.
- There's also a content disconnect: Marketers focus on real estate, education, economics, and health. Influencers (and their followers) prefer travel (63%), fashion, food, and beauty.

📌 What can companies do, according to this research?
- Set incentives tied to real outcomes: changed brand perception, leads, retention.
- Create a “shadow committee” of young advisors to stay in touch with real audience interests

Influencer marketing can work brilliantly, but only if you understand the cultural code of your audience.

Curious: Have you experienced this kind of disconnect?
